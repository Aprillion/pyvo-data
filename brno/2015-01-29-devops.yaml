    [The Foreman](http://theforeman.org/) is a provisioning and configuration
    management tool, integrating various providers, both from provisioning (bare-metal,
    oVirt, VMWare, libvirt, EC2, OpenStack) and configuration management (Puppet,  Chef,
    Salt) side. Besides other things, it''s plugable. [Katello](http://katello.org/)
    is a plugin, that brings content management into the play as well.

    I would like to go through the concepts and features of this two projects that
    I happened to work on (with help of other team members that will also be there
    to support me hopefully :)
