  description: 'We will show a daemon that wraps libnfc via swig. This daemon authenthicates
    user either via ISO14443A UID or Yubikey HMAC-SHA1 over NFC. The sample shows
    how the authenthication can be used to unlock door with WiringPi.

    Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) was the original target platform, but it can work on any
    platform that libnfc supports, including x86.'
